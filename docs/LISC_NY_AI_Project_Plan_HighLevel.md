# LISC NY AI Solutions Project: High-Level Plan

## Project Overview

The LISC NY AI Solutions Project is a time-bound initiative aimed at improving operational efficiency, optimizing staff capacity, and enhancing organizational performance through targeted AI applications. By automating routine processes and improving access to actionable data, this project supports LISC NY’s broader strategic objectives: service scalability, cost-effectiveness, and results-based management.

This initiative is grounded in operational alignment and stakeholder engagement. It is structured to ensure that solutions address measurable pain points, are informed by end-user experience, and are scalable across departments. The anticipated outcomes include reduced manual workloads, improved pipeline oversight, and enhanced decision-making quality across programs and operations.

Key areas of focus include:
- Workflow automation to reduce administrative burden  
- Enhanced data access to support planning and reporting  
- Tools that support agile, data-informed resource allocation
