# **AI Integration in Outgoing RFPs**

## **1. Overview**
LISC regularly issues **Requests for Proposals (RFPs)** to solicit bids from vendors, consultants, and service providers for community development projects, research initiatives, and financial partnerships. Managing the **RFP drafting, vendor selection, bid evaluation, and contract execution processes manually** can be **time-intensive, prone to human bias, and administratively burdensome**.

**AI-driven solutions can streamline the RFP lifecycle** by automating **document generation, vendor discovery, bid scoring, contract monitoring, and post-award compliance tracking**. This document outlines how **AI will be integrated into LISC’s outgoing RFP processes** to improve **efficiency, transparency, and data-driven decision-making**.
