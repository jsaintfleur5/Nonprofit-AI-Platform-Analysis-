# LISC NY AI Solutions Project: High-Level Plan

## Project Overview

The LISC NY AI Solutions Project is a strategic initiative to identify, develop, and implement artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that address key operational challenges across departments. The objective is to enable LISC NY to better serve communities by reducing administrative burden, improving pipeline management, and enhancing decision-making through data-driven insights.

The project emphasizes collaboration between staff and leadership to ensure AI tools align with actual workflows and organizational needs. Focus areas include AI-enabled process automation, natural language processing (NLP) for documentation support, and predictive analytics for program and impact tracking.

Primary stakeholders include LISC NY leadership, departmental staff, IT and data teams, and external technology partners.

## Project Phases and Timeline

## Potential Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

| Challenge                                 | Mitigation Strategy                                                  |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Staff resistance to AI adoption          | Provide early engagement, training, and transparent communication    |
| Limited data accessibility or quality    | Conduct early data inventory and start with narrow, well-defined pilots |
| Project resource or capacity constraints | Prioritize quick wins; bring in external support where needed        |

## Next Steps

- Complete internal review of survey findings  
- Finalize interactive presentation and rehearsal  
- Facilitate co-design session at the May 6 Staff Retreat  
- Capture insights and build out post-retreat roadmap
